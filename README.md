# BTC-LED-RING-Ticker
A Bitcoin ticker program that runs on an ESP32

Outer Neopixel ring main IN is connected to IO16 on ESP32
Display SDA connected to IO21 (which is SDA on the esp32)
Output of outer LED ring connects to input of inner LED Ring
Display SCL connected to IO22 (which is SCL on the esp32)
Make sure you enter your Wifi username and password below
You must press reset after uploading your program in order for the Display to work. Seems to be an issue with the ESP32
